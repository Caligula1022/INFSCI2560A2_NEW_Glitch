### What framework did you pick and why?

#### A: I chose the React framework. The reason is not only because React is the most popular framework in the world today, but also because it is very efficient and easy to use. React is used to create reusable user-interface components for each state, that can automatically update and render data without the need of reloading the page.So using React can provide a silky smooth experience. At the same time, the JSX syntax used in React was amazing and made me feel how powerful it is, making the process of front-end development a lot smoother. I was stunned when I discovered that I could create html elements directly in jsx. React also has its own DOM. The Virtual DOM is React's lightweight version of the Real DOM. Real DOM manipulation is substantially slower than virtual DOM manipulation. When an object's state changes, Virtual DOM updates only that object in the real DOM rather than all of them. This makes React a lot more efficient. Since I had some knowledge of angular before, I found this framework really easy to learn and understand when I was learning React. That's why I pick it.

#### Here are some React usage data.

- ##### 475k websites on the web are powered by React.
- ##### 64.8% of javascript developers are currently using React.
- ##### Ranked 1st most popular front-end javascript framework in State Of JS survey.
- ##### Github â€“ 120.5k stars, 21k forks and 1200 contributors.
